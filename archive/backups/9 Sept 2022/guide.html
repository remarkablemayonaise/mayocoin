  <h2>MayoCoin, LOBSTR, and You: A Beginner's Guide to MayoCoin</h2>
  
  <p>Crypto can be daunting to new users, so here's a step by step tutorial to set up a <a href="https://lobstr.co">LOBSTR</a> wallet for MayoCoin and Stellar's base currency, the Stellar Lumen (XLM). First, a little background.</p>

  <h3>MayoCoin is a Meme Coin</h3>
<p>Yes, MayoCoin is a proud member of the Stellar meme coin universe. We nod our heads to our daddy and mummy, <a href="https://ananos.tk/">Ananos</a> and <a href="https://manangos2.tk/">Manangos</a> and big brother <a href="https://stellarcannacoin.org/">Stellar Cannacoin</a>, who prefers to be called a <i>community token</i>. The meme coin we take greatest inspiration from is <a href="https://banano.cc/">Banano</a>, a fork of the cryptocurrency <a href="https://nano.org/">Nano</a>. Don't let the name <i>meme coin</i> put you off. There is space for utility and we have an active development team. While you may just have fun and learn a little, you might also make a little money along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
  Speculative projects such as MayoCoin do carry a large amount of risk. The vast majority of our users gently get acquainted with the project using almost no initial investment. There is no pressure to make rash decisions. MayoCoin is an opportunity to get on the ground floor of a crypto project that is fun and educational with incredible potential utility.</p>
  
  <h3>Stellar is not a Meme Coin</h3>
<p>Stellar is that shy, bespectacled kid at the back of the classroom, who quietly gets things done, quickly (transactions take ~4 seconds) and cheaply (~0.000001 USD per transaction) and quietly ~0.00022 kWh per transaction. It's the perfect platform for cheap, easy (no coding required) tokens. The Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is available for any asset, as well as liquidity pools (LP) and automated market makers (AMM) all on chain without relying on third party DApps or smart contracts. The only snag is that in order to hold Stellar assets like MayoCoin, you need to hold ~0.20 USD of Stellar Lumens (XLM), Stellar's base currency, as refundable deposit. At the moment XLM is hovering around the 30th position on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

  <h3>Price</h3>
  
  <p>For now (August 2022), MayoCoin is very cheap with 100,000 MayoCoin ~ 1 USD. While there are other ways to get MayoCoin there may never be another opportunity to buy them at this price. Sources of free MayoCoin include airdrops, faucets, staking and HODLing lotteries, trivia and using your computer to map the Milky Way. Tipping on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mayocoin/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/Vj8MY7uDct">Discord</a> is what holds the community together. Participate and have fun and you'll have a few MayoCoin in no time. Don't knock it until you've tried it!</p>
  
  <h3>Let's get some MayoCoin</h3>
  
  <h4>Step 1: Download <a href="https://lobstr.co">LOBSTR</a></h4>
  
  <p>Download <a href="https://lobstr.co">LOBSTR</a> on Android/iPhone or open it in your browser.
  Alternatively search for "LOBSTR" on Google Play / App Store and download it.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Create a Wallet or Import a 12-Word Seed Phrase</h4>
  <p>Follow the instructions, have an email address ready, and WRITE DOWN YOUR SEED PHRASE when prompted. Alternatively import your 12-word seed phrase from Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet etc. Wallets are only secure when you don't share your <i>secret / private key</i> (S...) or <i>seed phrase</i> (usually 12 words) with anyone. Ever. For any reason. Write down your 12-word seed phrase and keep it in a safe place.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Get Some Stellar Lumens</h4>
<p>At least 1.6 Stellar Lumens (XLM) (~0.20 USD) are needed to activate your Stellar address. Stellar Lumens can be purchased on almost every exchange including <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://www.binance.com/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.stellar.org/lumens/exchanges">many others</a>. At the time of this posting, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learning-rewards">Coinbase Learning Rewards</a> is giving away ~20 USD of free cryptocurrencies for watching slideshows and answering simple questions. Convert these cryptocurrencies to Stellar Lumens (XLM).</p>

<h4>Step 4: Activate and Fund Your Stellar Wallet</h4>
<p>In the LOBSTR App home page, select the the top-left <i>three lines</i> menu, and choose <i>Receive</i> and <i>Stellar Address</i>. Stellar addresses always begin with <i>G...</i>. This is your public address and can be shared freely. Copy this into the clipboard. In your exchange wallet choose <i>Pay/Send Stellar Lumens (XLM)</i> (or similar). Paste your Stellar address <i>G...</i> and send. You do not need a <i>memo</i> to send to your personal LOBSTR address. If your exchange is working properly your LOBSTR wallet will be activated and funded in a few seconds.</p>

<p>N.B. Stellar Lumens can be bought in the LOBSTR app directly (via MoonPay), but fees and minimum purchases are less competitive than other exchanges.</p>

<h4>Step 5: Add MayoCoin as an Asset</h4>
  
<p>In the LOBSTR App home page, select the the top-left <i>three lines</i> menu, and choose <i>Assets</i>. Select + (plus), <i>Add Asset</i> in the top right hand corner. Search for <i>mayocoin</i>. Select MayoCoin then <i>Add Asset</i> and <i>Confirm and Proceed</i>. Alternatively MayoCoin can be <a href="web+stellar:tx?xdr=AAAAAgAAAAAoIjJrjnxt4TajItKKySFvV40Ygb0tx9US5RChEA1W%2FAAAJxAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAEaI6MAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAABgAAAAJNYXlvQ29pbgAAAAAAAAAAuzW7EQEuw8k9PsWcZrPWkZkMDXaE5K5ClVmcxl%2BFH3Z%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwAAAAAAAAAA&replace=sourceAccount%3AX%2CseqNum%3AY%3BX%3Aaccount%20to%20which%20add%20the%20trustline%2CY%3Asequence%20number%20of%20your%20account">added directly</a> or by scanning the QR code through LOBSTR. You now have a <i>trustline</i> to MayoCoin and can have some fun with it. Congratulations!</p>
<a href="web+stellar:tx?xdr=AAAAAgAAAAAoIjJrjnxt4TajItKKySFvV40Ygb0tx9US5RChEA1W%2FAAAJxAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAEaI6MAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAABgAAAAJNYXlvQ29pbgAAAAAAAAAAuzW7EQEuw8k9PsWcZrPWkZkMDXaE5K5ClVmcxl%2BFH3Z%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwAAAAAAAAAA&replace=sourceAccount%3AX%2CseqNum%3AY%3BX%3Aaccount%20to%20which%20add%20the%20trustline%2CY%3Asequence%20number%20of%20your%20account"><img src="MayoCoin_QR.png" alt="QR code" style="width:128px;height:128px"></a>
  
  <h3>Let's have some fun with MayoCoin</h3>
  
  <p>For all of these activities use your Stellar address <i>G...</i> from Step 4.</p>

<h4>Receive Free MayoCoin with our Faucet</h4>
<p>Paste your Stellar address into our <a href="https://something.nothingbuteverything.xyz/mayo">faucet</a>. You should receive some MayoCoin in seconds.</p>
  
<h4>Get an Airdrop</h4>
<p>You are now ready for a tasty airdrop. Fill in the form on the <a href="index.html">front page</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkWSqyUFjADarN8FmSsEYU5v0b2VT2vfKnMMoFkdP8taZFuA/viewform?usp=sf_link">directly</a>.
  
<h4>Buy MayoCoin</h4>
<p>In the LOBSTR App home page, select the the top-left <i>three lines</i> menu, and choose <i>Swap</i>. In the dropdown menus select <i>sell - XLM</i> and <i>buy - MayoCoin</i>. Choose an amount of XLM to sell (or MayoCoin to buy) and select <i>Swap XLM to MayoCoin</i>. You can swap any Stellar asset to MayoCoin directly.
  
<h4>Withdraw MayoCoin from your Reddit / Discord Tipbot Account</h4>
  <p>Use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=mayo_tipbot&subject=command&message=send%201%20G...">the Reddit tipbot</a> to send MayoCoin to your Stellar wallet. Swap <i>1</i> for the amount you want to sell and <i>G...</i> for your Stellar address. Here is <a href="https://github.com/drelor-online/mayo-reddit-tipbot">a list of commands</a>.</p>
    
<p>In Discord send the command: <code>"/withdraw amount:1 token:Mayo address:G..."</code> to the tipbot. In the command swap <i>1</i> for the amount you want to sell and <i>G...</i> for your Stellar address.</p>

  <h4>Deposit MayoCoin to your Reddit / Discord Tipbot Account</h4>
   <p>To send MayoCoin to another Stellar address, in the LOBSTR app home page, select the the top-left <i>three lines</i> menu, and choose <i>Send</i> and <i>Stellar wallet</i>. Paste the correct Stellar address, choose an amount of MayoCoin and DON'T FORGET TO ADD YOUR MEMO!</p>
 <p> To send MayoCoin to your Reddit tipbot account use the Stellar address, <code>GARDBQHEUURLOWHEAC6GFIHYWHGCVJBH4V3REG2CD465GP3LDOVSSDO5</code> using your Reddit username as the memo (no "u/") e.g. <code>remarkablemayonaise</code>.</p>
  <p> To send MayoCoin to your Discord tipbot account use the command: <code>"/deposit token:mayo"</code>. Use the Stellar address and memo given.</p>
    
    <h4>That's all you need to know. Well done!</h4>
      <p>Hey, you promised us staking and HODLing lotteries, trivia and using your computer to map the Milky Way! No fair!</p>
  
 <p>Okay, that isn't everything, but then where would the fun be? Head to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mayocoin/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/Vj8MY7uDct">Discord</a> or possibly <a href="https://twitter.com/mayocoin69">Twitter</a> for these fun and games and more! There are even a few clues on the <a href="index.html">front page</a>.</p>
